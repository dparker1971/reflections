The meta data for the repository is created and git starts its magic
Staging area would be for work I considered complete. Seperates changes
Adding the incremental changes to the staging area
Branches could help innovate while not interuping a stable product
I can see where the changes were made and if they can be merged
All previously reachable commit are merged together, To understand the hirearchy.
